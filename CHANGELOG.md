This is the first release from the single bindig repository that is not a fork of the official openHAB Addons2 repository anymore. It is now much easier to only update the binding without any impact of other official bindings. The Maven files are copied from the openHAB repo the keep the binding aligned with the official developments.

- Added ``Nullable`` support to the project

### Fixed
- Fixed wrong ``ebusd`` driver instance check

- Fixed several compiler and test warnings
